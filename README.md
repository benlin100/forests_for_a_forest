# How Random Is Your Forest?
My project focused on a dataset from the National Roosevelt Forest in Colorado. With hopes to expand the forest and develop new areas, the objective of this project is to predict the predominant tree type in a section of the forest.  

**Getting Started**   
With Python installed and configured, the code .ipynb files may be run directly through Jupyter Notebook.  
  
*Required Libraries*  
If any libraries are missing, they may be easily installed with the command pip install --upgrade [library].

- pandas  
- numpy  
- sklearn  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn
- scipy  

**Repository Structure**  
- code: Contains scripts to run  
- data: Datafiles  
- slides: Presentation slides  
- summary: Project write-up
