# How Random Is Your Forest?
The objectives of this project is 1) predicting the predominant tree type in a section of the Roosevelt National Forest 2) determining the optimal soil type for that section. 

**Getting Started**   
With Python installed and configured, the code .ipynb files may be run directly through Jupyter Notebook.  
  
*Required Libraries*  
If any libraries are missing, they may be easily installed with the command pip install --upgrade [library].

- pandas  
- numpy  
- sklearn  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn
- scipy  

**Repository Structure**  
code: Contains scripts to run  
soils: Contains chart with the optimal soil types for a particular tree type
